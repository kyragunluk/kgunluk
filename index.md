## About Me

I am a Senior at Cornell University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics, Operations Research, and Game Design. I am graduating in the spring of 2024, and plan to continue to graduate school. I am particularly interested in Algorithms and Theory in Computer Science. My emails are kg556@cornell.edu and kyra.gunluk@gmail.com

## Research Interests

My mentor is Dr. Ruta Mehta, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She also has a research interest in Theoretical Computer Science. Her website can be found at https://rutamehta.cs.illinois.edu/

## About My Project

This summer, Professor Mehta and I will be exploring different notions of fairness, such as Maximin Share and Any Price Share. With these we will explore which measurements can be guaranteed in problems of distributing indivisible items to a collection of agents who each give value to the items, and if we can find approximation factors and algorithms for those that can be.
